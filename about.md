<p>Descartes, the philosopher, once said, "There is no beauty comparable to the beauty of truth". I have always interpreted the word 'truth' to refer to the reality of two different types of worlds: the tangible and the intangible worlds. The 'truth' of the tangible world falls under the domain of mathematics and the sciences while the 'truth' of the intangible world is what different religions and ideologies strive to find. My objective in life is to study both of these kinds of 'truths'.</p>

<p>While most things can be easily characterized as either tangible or intangible things, intelligence cannot. We, for example, do not know whether intelligence (and consciousness) is material or immaterial and consequently if it has a mathematical representation or not. Therefore, intelligence is both a philosphical and mathematical field of study. This is perhaps the reason why the field of intelligence is far more elegant than almost all other fields of study. This is also the reason why I am particulary interested in artificial intelligence - the field that tries to find a mathematical representation for intelligence.</p>
